# Documentation Style Guidelines

In general references, don't use an article with _iPod_. When referring to the user's particular iPod, it's OK to use _your_. The capacity and generation can be listed before or after the name: _128 GB iPod touch_, _iPod nano (16 GB)_, _fourth-generation iPod touch_, _iPod shuffle (3rd generation or later)_. Use the numeral when the generation comes after the model name. Don't shorten _generation_ to _gen_ or _G_; for example, _fifth-gen iPod_ or _iPod 5G_.

> The sixth-generation iPod nano features a Multi-Touch display.

> If you experience problems with your iPod...

Always include _iPod_ in the name; don't use _classic_, _mini_, _nano_, _photo_, _shuffle_, or _touch_ alone. Don't capitalize iPod names even in title-style headings: _iPod touch_, not _iPod Touch_.
