# iTunesSD

The `iTunesSD` file contains the databse used by iPod shuffle. There are two versions: a simplistic big-endian version used on the [1st and 2nd generation](./1st-and-2nd-generation.md) iPod shuffle, and a more complex little-endian version used on the [3rd and 4th generation](./3rd-and-4th-generation.md) iPod shuffle.
