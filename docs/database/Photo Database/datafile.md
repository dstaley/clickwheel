# Data File (`mhfd`)

offset | field | size | value
------ | ----- | ---- | -----
0 | header identifier | 4 | mhfd
4 | header length | 4 | size of the mhfd header (0x84)
8 | total length | 4 | size of the header and all child records (since everything is a child of MHFD, this will always be the size of the entire file)
12 | unknown1 | 4 | always seem to be 0
16 | unknown2 | 4 | always seem to be 1 for older databases, in an ArtworkDB generated by iTunes 4.9 or above, it's 2. Caution: iTunes7 removes the whole database if this field is 1
20 | number of children | 4 | always 3 since there are 3 list holders
24 | unknown3 | 4 | always seem to be 0
28 | next id for mhii | 4 | The id of last mhii + 1. (is probably used as the id of a newly added mhii and then incremented). On an iPod video seems to be the id of the last mhii + the total number of photo albums (mhba) + 1.
32 | unknown5 | 8 | 
40 | unknown6 | 8 | 
48 | unknown7 | 4 | always seem to be 2
52 | unknown8 | 4 | always seem to be 0
56 | unknown9 | 4 | always seem to be 0
60 | unknown10 | 4 | 
64 | unknown11 | 4 | 

The rest of the header is zero padded.
